## The challenges we're facing

We're rapidly changing the way we build and produce solutions for our costumers. Right now, we're in the middle of building a new set of systems to power our operation while slowly migrating our users away from our old codebase. This means that we're basically seweing our parachute on our way down. ü™Ç

The team we're trying to build right now is aware of the work that's ahead of us: 

- We are growing and our systems need to grow too
- We need to question our decisions at every step of the way, and do not fall for the sunk-cost fallacy
- The business is changing rapidly, so we need to design systems modular-enough so that we can change rapidly as well

## Stack

- Ruby on Rails
- React
- Vue.js
- MongoDB
- PostgreSQL

## How we work

- We're in love with the MVP, all things need to be done but we like to release often and learn fast
- Your code needs to be readable by another homie
- We know that it can be boring sometimes, but documentation is the only way to keep tracking what we do and how we do it
- You're the owner of your work, you're the person who knows which is the way to solve a problem
